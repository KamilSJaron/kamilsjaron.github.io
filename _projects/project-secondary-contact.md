title: "Model of secondary contact hybrid zones"
collection: projects
---

My previous work was about modeling secondary contact hybrid zones, a place where two distinct (sub)species hybridize. I built a new simulation model that would help address questions that are hard to address using exact solutions (multilocus clines). The software I made for this purpose is called [Conjunction](htpps://github.com/KamilSJaron/Conjunction) hosted with love by GitHub.
