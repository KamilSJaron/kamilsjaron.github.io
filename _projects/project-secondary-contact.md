title: "Conjunction: a simulator of secondary CONtact using Firsher's JUNCTION model of admixture."
excerpt: "How does a normal multilocus hybrid zone look like?"
collection: projects

My previous work was about modeling secondary contact hybrid zones, a place where two distinct (sub)species hybridize. I built a new simulation model that would help address questions that are hard to address using exact solutions (multilocus clines). The software I made for this purpose is called [Conjunction](htpps://github.com/KamilSJaron/Conjunction) hosted with love by GitHub.
