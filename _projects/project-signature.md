Genomic signature, kmer frequencies are unique trait if sequences carrying a (more-less) species-specific signal ([Karlin, 1995](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952500890769); [Karamichalis, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1157-8)). There are attempts to use to reconstruct phylogeny, to detect horizontal gene transfer events or for sorting out metagenomic samples. Well, signature seems like a good statistics for all those application, but for some reason nobody ever tried to find out, what is causing this pattern, how comes that signature along genome varies less then among species?

To get a bit of an idea what could possibly lie behind, we decided to associate divergence of regions to typical genomic signature to available genomic annotations. This project is my idea that I got when I was trying to develop yet another method searching for candidates for horizontal gene transfer, scalable to eukaryotic genomes. Titouan, a master student under my supervision, is working on the project. Progress is publicly available on his GitHub repo:[ SouVarGenSig](https://github.com/UrsusSalificus/SouVarGenSig) (there is not much yet).
