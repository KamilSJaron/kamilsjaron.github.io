This is course I have co-developed with Amina Echchiki, Daniel L. Jeffries and Walid Gharib. The full description can be found at the [webpage of SIB](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/2017-11-longreads). The teaching materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aechchiki/SIB_LongReadsWorkshop_Zurich17).

This workshop have covered basic handling of both whole genome sequencing (mostly me) and sequencing of RNA (mostly Amina). Thanks to Walid, the workshop runs in a docker, so it should be fairly possible to run it anywhere.
