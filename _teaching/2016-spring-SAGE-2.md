Students extract RNA in four different conditions for an RNA-seq experiment on the bacterial strains they sequenced last semester. Students do a quality control of reads, trimming and pseudo-mapping reads to calculate transcript abundances and perform a downstream analysis using R with emphasis on genes they have annotated last semester.
