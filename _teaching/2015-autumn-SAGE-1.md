Students are sequencing a genome of bacteria using latest sequencing technologies, assemble genome, map sequencing reads and build a gene annotation.

I am responsible to teach students terminal operations (basics of UNIX) and cluster computing. These skills are essential for the rest of the class, since without this skill it would be hard to perform analyses of ngs data.

I have participated in this class in years 2015, 2016 and 2017. I am going to teaching again in 2018.

All the materials I have created or co-created for all the years are [available at GitHub](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/Sequence-a-genome).
