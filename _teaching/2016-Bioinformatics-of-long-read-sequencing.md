This is course I have co-developed with Amina Echchiki, Walid Gharib and  	Julien Roux. The full description can be found at the [webpage of SIB](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/2016-07-longreads-sequencing) and [the teaching materials are available at GitHub](https://github.com/aechchiki/SIB_LongReadsWorkshop_Bern16). The goals of this workshop was to get hands-on experience with :

- Identification of the various applications, advantages and limitations of the methods presented
- Quality control of long read datasets
- Extraction of raw reads and align them to a reference genome
- De novo assembly of long reads

Note that the materials of the following year were much nicer.
