I assisted students on individual basis, helping them to understand the practical exercises and getting them done. The practicals I have assisted to were covering concepts like Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, statistical testing of the departure from HW, calculation and interpretation of fst statistics between populations, effect of selection on genotype frequencies in case of heterozygosity advantage, and migration.
