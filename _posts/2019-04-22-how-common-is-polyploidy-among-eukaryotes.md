This easter I have spent on thinking / writing / editing of an introduction to the paper about [smudgeplot](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/smudgeplot) - a tool for predicting ploidy and visualization of genome structure.
I collaborated on this tool for my own data, I have not really thought through how far it goes, so I started to wonder how many polyploid species are out there.
So I asked on Twitter and guess what, so many people have responded to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/KamilSJaron/status/1119582741023076352) that I have decided to compile the answers in a blogpost.

### polyploidy in exant species


### polyploidy from evolutionary perspective

([Van de Peer at al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.26)) - nice tree, strangely they call polyploidy dead end

### consequences of polyploidy

### polyploidy within organisms

### Conclusion

Polyploidy should not be seen as evolutionary dead end since there are so many lineages with polyploid ancestors.
