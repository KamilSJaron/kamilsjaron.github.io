Hi, I am Kamil, some people call me Slim (means slug). In September 2015 I joined labs of [Marc Robinson-Rechavi](http://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuinst/people/group-leaders/prof-marc-robinson-rechavi.html) and [Tanja Schwander](http://www.unil.ch/dee/home/menuinst/research/schwander-group.html) at University of Lausanne as PhD student. So what do I care about...

Sexuality and admixture
------

Amphioxus is a fish-like organism with the highest known heterozygocity. The SNPs and variable indels are covering about 9% of its genome. How comes that individuals with that different genome still have same body plan and how comes that they still can mate with each other? When I say, that I am fascinated by diversity of life, this is what I have in my mind, rather than wondering about beaks and feather colours of tropical birds.

My PhD project has a great potential to contribute to studies of admixture, since the system I am working on is genus of stick insects Timema that contains at least five independent asexual lineages. This genus represent a great opportunity to access direct effect of asexuality, i.e. absence of admixture. We sequence pairs of genomes of sexual and asexual sister species, which allows us to confront all verbal models about parthenogenesis created in past century: from accumulation of deleterious mutations and heterozygocity, to large scale rearrangements and TE activityâ€¦

I also like open-source and open-science (everything I do is on my GitHub), statistics, genome assembly, well-written documentation, README files, markdown languages, non-anonymous reviewers and declared conflicts of interests.

I also used to work with system of reduced gene flow - secondary contact hybrid zones, where two distinct (sub)species hybridize. I tried to build a new simulation model that would help address questions that are hard to address using exact solutions (multilocus clines). The software I made for this purpose is called [Conjunction](htpps://github.com/KamilSJaron/Conjunction) hosted with love by GitHub.
