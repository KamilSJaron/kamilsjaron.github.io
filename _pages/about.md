Hi, I am Kamil, some people call me Slim (means slug). In September 2015 I joined labs of [Marc Robinson-Rechavi](http://www.unil.ch/dee/home/menuinst/research/robinson-rechavi-group.html) and [Tanja Schwander](http://www.unil.ch/dee/home/menuinst/research/schwander-group.html) at University of Lausanne as PhD student. The vast majority of my research is about system with extraordinary admixture: hybrid zones with reduced gene flow, amphioxus genome with huge heterozygocity or effect of asexuality to genome shape - i.e. absence of admixture (see projects for more).

I like open-source and open-science, statistics, genome assembly, well-written documentation, README files, markdown languages, non-anonymous reviewers and declared conflicts of interests.
